# HavocOrders

Player-driven buy orders for **Paper / Purpur 1.21.7+**, built entirely on Minecraft's
native **Dialog API**. No chest GUIs anywhere — every screen is a real dialog window.

Players post orders ("I'll pay $12 each for 512 diamonds"), anyone can deliver and get paid
instantly, and the owner collects, drops, or sells the loot.

## Requirements

- **Server:** Paper or Purpur **1.21.7 or newer** (that's when Paper shipped the dialog API)
- **Client:** Minecraft **1.21.6 or newer** — dialogs do not render on older clients
- **Vault** plus an economy provider (EssentialsX Economy, CMI, ...)
- JDK 21 to build

## Screens

| Dialog | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Orders | The board: paged, sortable, filterable, searchable |
| Deliver | Progress bar, what you're carrying, payout preview, quick-amount buttons |
| Your Orders | Your active orders, escrow total, loot counter, delivery-alert toggle |
| Manage Order | Per-order detail, collect or cancel — also where your own orders on the board lead |
| New Order | Item + amount + price, all in one dialog |
| Item Picker | Every orderable item, paged with filter and search |
| Enchant Picker | Every enchantment and level, for enchanted books |
| Collect | Your loot: collect, drop, or sell |
| Confirm dialogs | Cancel order, sell all, drop all |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/orders` | Open the board — everything else is reachable from inside |
| `/orders reload` | Reload config and dialogs |

Sub-commands for your orders, collecting, and selling were removed; those are buttons now.

Permissions: `havocorders.use` (default true), `havocorders.admin` (default op).

## Number shorthand

Every amount and price field accepts shorthand, in input and output:

- `1k` = 1,000 · `2.5k` = 2,500 · `1m` = 1,000,000 · `3b`, `1t`, `1q`
- `$` signs, commas and underscores are ignored, so `$1,250` works
- Amount fields also accept `all`, `max`, and `half`

Display abbreviates the same way (`1.23m`). Turn that off with
`SETTINGS.ABBREVIATE-NUMBERS: false` — input shorthand keeps working either way.

## Search privacy

Search uses the dialog's own text field. The value goes straight from your client to the
server with the button click: it never enters chat, so it does not appear in the chat box,
in other players' screenshots, or in chat-logging plugins. This is the same privacy a sign
would give you, without the fake-block packet hacks.

## Dialog size

Multi-action dialogs lay their buttons out in a grid, and the API defaults to **2 columns**,
which is why the window looked cramped. Size is now configurable:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  DIALOG:
    COLUMNS: 3        # grid width
    BUTTON-WIDTH: 200 # pixels per button, 1-1024
    ITEM-SIZE: 48     # item preview size, 1-256 (vanilla default is 16)
  ORDERS-PER-PAGE: 21
  ITEMS-PER-PAGE: 27
  COLLECT-PER-PAGE: 15
```

Roughly, window width is `COLUMNS x BUTTON-WIDTH`. Three 200px columns fills most of a
normal-scale screen; push `BUTTON-WIDTH` toward 300 or `COLUMNS` to 4 if you run a low GUI
scale. Any dialog can override the column count on its own with a `COLUMNS:` key in
`dialogs.yml` — the deliver screen uses 2 because it is mostly text and inputs.

Dialogs scroll, so the per-page counts are far higher than a chest GUI allowed: 21 orders
per page in a 3-wide grid is seven rows at a glance.

Back and Close now sit in the dialog's dedicated footer slot rather than taking up a grid
cell, so the grid is all content.

## Shulker support

Deliveries read and pull from shulker boxes the player is carrying, so nobody has to
unpack a box first. The deliver screen splits the count:

```
In your inventory: 128
In your shulkers:  1,728
```

Loose stacks are taken first and shulker contents second, so boxes stay packed as long as
possible. Emptied boxes are kept, never consumed.

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  SHULKERS:
    DELIVER-FROM-SHULKERS: true
    CACHE-MILLIS: 1000
```

**Why the cache exists:** reading a shulker's contents deserialises its block state, which
is not cheap, and the order board asks "how many do you have" once per visible order. With
21 orders on screen and a few boxes in your inventory, an uncached implementation would
unpack every box twenty-odd times per redraw. One scan now counts everything you carry and
that snapshot is reused for a second. Anything that moves items invalidates it, and
deliveries always re-scan before touching your inventory, so the cache can only ever make a
displayed number a second stale — never the amount that actually moves.

Note that a *filled* shulker is only matched by an identically filled one, because item
matching compares full item data. Ordering "a shulker box" means an empty one.

## The deliver screen

The busiest screen, so it gets the most detail:

- A progress bar and percentage for the order
- How much is still wanted, and how much the order has paid out so far
- How many matching items you are carrying, how many you can deliver right now, and
  exactly what that pays
- What filling the whole order would pay
- A free-text amount field accepting `1k`, `2.5k`, `half`, `all`
- **Quick-amount buttons** from `QUICK-AMOUNTS` in `dialogs.yml` (default 64 / 576 / 1728 —
  a stack, nine stacks, a shulker). They only appear when you can actually deliver that
  many, so the screen never shows a button that would fail.

Set your own amounts per server:

```yaml
DELIVER:
  COLUMNS: 3
  QUICK-AMOUNTS: [ 64, 576, 1728 ]
```

`{progress}`, `{percent}`, `{held}`, `{deliverable}`, `{payout}` and `{full_payout}` are
available in its body lines and tooltips.

## Importing from the original DonutOrders

Drop the old plugin's `orders.db` into `plugins/HavocOrders/` as `import.db` and start the
server, or run `/orders import [file]`. The old schema (`orders` + `profiles`) is read
directly, including its `BukkitObjectOutputStream` item blobs.

What comes across:

| Legacy | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `id` (8 chars) | A fixed UUID derived from it, so re-importing skips duplicates |
| `deliver` / `deliverName` | Order owner |
| `maxAmount` / `currentAmount` / `collectedAmount` | Amount, delivered, collected |
| `unitItemPrice` / `currentPaid` | Price and payout history |
| `serializedItem` | The exact item, falling back to `material` if the blob won't read |
| `createdDate` / `expireDate` | Timestamps (`DATE-FORMAT`, `TIMEZONE`) |
| `profiles.orderAlerts` | Each player's delivery-notification choice |

**The importer never moves money and never drops loot.** Delivered and paid figures come
across as history only, because the old plugin already handled those payments. Uncollected
items stay owed and appear in the collect screen as normal.

Two settings deserve a decision before you run it:

```yaml
IMPORT:
  ESCROW-ALREADY-HELD: true
  EXPIRY:
    MODE: EXTEND      # or KEEP
    EXTEND-DAYS: 7
```

`ESCROW-ALREADY-HELD` decides whether cancelling an imported order pays a refund. The
original plugin charged order value up front and refunded undelivered items, so `true` is
correct for it — the money exists and the player is owed it. Set it to `false` if your old
setup did not hold that money, otherwise cancelling imported orders mints currency. Orders
carry this flag individually, so imported and native orders can coexist safely.

`EXPIRY.MODE` handles orders that expired while the old plugin was down. `EXTEND` gives
them a fresh window and keeps them live. `KEEP` imports them as expired — loot is still
collectable, but no refund is issued, since the old plugin owned that decision.

Remove the old plugin before importing so the two are not running against one economy.
The file is renamed to `*.imported` afterwards so a restart doesn't re-read it.

## Order limits

`MAX-ORDERS-PER-PLAYER` defaults to **0, meaning unlimited**. Set it to a number to cap
active orders per player; admins with `havocorders.admin` bypass any cap.

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  MAX-ORDERS-PER-PLAYER: 0
```

Escrow still applies per order, so a player's real limit is their balance.

## Bulk orders

Orders are built for volume. Defaults:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX-ITEM-AMOUNT` | 1,000,000 items per order |
| `MAX-PRICE-AMOUNT` | 10,000,000 per item |
| `MAX-ORDER-VALUE` | 1,000,000,000 total (`0` disables the check) |

`MAX-ORDER-VALUE` is the one that matters: amount x price is what gets pulled from the
player's balance up front, so the ceiling stops someone posting an order worth more than
your economy can represent.

Large orders never materialise as item stacks. Loot is tracked as a count against the
order, the collect screen shows one entry per order rather than one per stack, and drops
cut stacks off a counter as they are released. A million-item order costs the same memory
as a one-item order.

## Dropping loot

The Collect dialog has three drop buttons:

- **Drop Page** — the entries currently on screen
- **Drop N Pages** — the next N pages from where you are (`SETTINGS.DROP.PAGE-BATCH`)
- **Drop All** — everything, behind a confirmation dialog

Stacks are generated as they are dropped, a few per tick (`MAX-STACKS-PER-TICK`, default
24), so "Drop All" on a million items is a slow trickle rather than a frozen server.
`MAX-TOTAL-STACKS` is an optional ceiling on one drop action (`0` = no limit). Book-keeping
happens up front, so nothing is ever owed twice — and if you log out mid-drop, the
remainder falls where you were standing instead of vanishing.

Because collect entries are per order rather than per stack, the page buttons only matter
if you have more waiting orders than `COLLECT-PER-PAGE`.

## Performance

- The full order set lives in memory; nothing queries the database during play.
- Writes go into a dirty set flushed by **one** batched async transaction every 30s
  (`SAVE-INTERVAL-SECONDS`), so a busy server doesn't spawn a thread per delivery.
- Orders are indexed by owner, so "your orders" never scans the whole set.
- The board caches its filtered, sorted result per player and rebuilds only when the order
  set actually changed (a version counter) or the player changed a filter — a page turn is
  a list slice.
- Order quantity is a number, never a list of stacks, so bulk orders cost nothing extra.
- The item picker is pre-bucketed by category with pre-lowercased names, so filtering is a
  map lookup and searching is one pass over an already-narrowed list.
- Dialog buttons use local click callbacks, so there is no global event handler firing for
  every dialog click on the server.
- The only repeating tasks are the expiry sweep (60s) and the save flush (30s).

## Sell All

`SELL.PRICES` sets the per-item value; anything missing falls back to `SELL.DEFAULT-PRICE`
(`0` = not sellable, stays in the collect list). `SELL.MULTIPLIER` scales everything.

## Config files

- `config.yml` — database, economy, limits, sell prices, drop safety, messages
- `dialogs.yml` — every title, body line, button label and tooltip, with `{placeholders}`
  and hex colours (`&#f40d0d`)
